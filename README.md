## Task 

develop the initial scaffolding for your first portfolio site as well as create and/or update other materials so that you can showcase your skills to potential employer.


## Approach 

I used the activites and help from the assistance for this task. Going over the activites and doing some extra google search helped with this task. I used external websites like stack-overflow, mdm, and chatgpt etc. These tools helped me develop the code I have so far.
